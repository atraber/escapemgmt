# Escape Room Management Platform
This repository contains the backend and the frontend of the escape room
management platform used in Houdini's Quest.

The backend lives in the `backend` folder and is written in python using flask.
See the `backend` folder for more details.

The frontend lives in the `frontend` folder and is written in TypeScript using
the angular framework.
See the `frontend` folder for more details.

Finally there is a special `frontscreen` folder that only contains the files
necessary to render a general overview frontscreen. In principle this can be
merged with the normal frontend and this should be doen as soon as possible.
